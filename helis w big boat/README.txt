Coastal Callouts templates

Templates adapted from textures or paintkits provided by the respective vehicle authors. 
Please refer to CREDITS.TXT in the main Coastal Callouts download.

You are welcome to release textures for any of the vehicles included in the 
Coastal Callouts DLC, subject to the following conditions: 

 - You MAY NOT release/republish any original files, including any YFT or YTD files,
   without explicit prior written permission from PNWParksFan. Only release texture 
   packs as standalone image files (png or DDS).
   
 - You MAY NOT sell any texture pack created from Coastal Callouts directly for money or 
   for "donations", whether for private use, Patreon, donations, FiveM clans, or any other 
   purpose. It is OK to accept donations in general for your works which may include these 
   textures, but you may not specifically charge people to access this content. 

 - You must include a direct link to the Coastal Callouts download page in your 
   texture pack download page and in the readme or credits file for your file.
 
 - If you are creating a large retexture pack (e.g. for a complete international 
   pack or something similar), please contact PNWParksFan to discuss making it 
   an official Coastal Callouts add-on. 
   
 - Please respect the work of the contributors to this mod by releasing high-quality 
   work yourself. Don't publish rushed, low-quality textures.
